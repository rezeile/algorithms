/*
 * An implementation of a class that represents the 
 * mathematical concept of a graph. A graph G = (V,E)
 * is a set of vertices and edges. In a directed 
 * graph each (a,b) in E is ordered and in an 
 * undirected graph each (a,b) is an unordered set
 * in E.
 *
 * The following implementation exports the following
 * methods.
 *
 * addVertex - adds a new vertex to the graph
 * removeVertex
 * addEdge(v1,v2) - adds an edge connecting vertices
 * 					v1 and v2
 * removeEdge(v1,v2)
